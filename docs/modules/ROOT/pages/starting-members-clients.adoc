= Starting the Members and Clients
[[starting-the-member-and-client]]

Having installed Hazelcast and assuming you have the required
libraries of your preferred client language, let's see how we can start the
members and clients.

**Members:**

[tabs] 
==== 
Shell:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,shell]
----
// Starts a standalone member:

sh bin/start.sh
----
--

Docker::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
docker run hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
----
--

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
Config cfg = new Config();
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(cfg);
----
====

NOTE: `start.sh` / `start.bat` scripts lets you start one Hazelcast instance
per directory. To start a new instance, please unzip Hazelcast ZIP or TAR.GZ
package in a new directory.

NOTE: You can also use the start scripts to deploy your own library to a
Hazelcast member. See the xref:clusters:deploying-code-from-clients.adoc#adding-user-library-to-classpath[Adding User
Library to CLASSPATH section].

**Clients:**

[tabs] 
==== 
Java:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,java]
----
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
HazelcastInstance hzclient = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
----
--

C++::
+
--
[source,cpp]
----
hazelcast::client::ClientConfig config;
hazelcast::client::HazelcastClient hzclient(config);
----
--

C Sharp::
+
--
[source,cs]
----
var cfg = new ClientConfig();
var hzclient = HazelcastClient.NewHazelcastClient(cfg);
----
--

Node.js::
+
--
[source,javascript]
----
const { Client } = require('hazelcast-client');
const hzclient = await Client.newHazelcastClient();
----
--

Python::
+
--
[source,python]
----
config = hazelcast.ClientConfig()
hzclient = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(config)
----
--

Go::
+
[source,go]
----
config := hazelcast.NewConfig()
hzclient , _ := hazelcast.NewClientWithConfig(config)

Hazelcast also offers a tool, **Management Center**, that enables you to monitor your cluster.
It is included in your Hazelcast IMDG download package and can also be downloaded
from the Hazelcast website's https://hazelcast.org/download/#management-center[download page^].
You can use this tool to monitor your cluster, cluster members, clients, data structures
and WAN replications. See the xref:management-center::index.adoc[documentation] for details on Hazelcast Management Center.

By default, Hazelcast uses multicast to discover other members that can form a cluster.  If you are
working with other Hazelcast developers on the same network, you may find yourself joining their
clusters under the default settings.  Hazelcast provides a way to segregate clusters within the same
network when using multicast. See the xref:clusters:creating-clusters.adoc[Creating Clusters section]
for more information.  Alternatively, if you do not wish to use the default multicast mechanism,
you can provide a fixed list of IP addresses that are allowed to join. See
the xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc#join[Join configuration section] for more information.

NOTE: If you prefer to use this mechanism, make sure that your network is enclosed and secure.
See the xref:clusters:discovery-mechanisms.adoc[Discovery Mechanisms section].

NOTE: You can also check the video tutorials https://hazelcast.org/imdg/get-started[here^].

== Example Application

In this short tutorial, you perform the following activities:

. Create a simple Java application using the Hazelcast distributed map and queue.
. Run our application twice to have a cluster with two members (JVMs).
. Connect to our cluster from another Java application by using the
Hazelcast Native Java Client API.

Let's begin.


* The following code starts the first Hazelcast member and
creates and uses the `customers` map and queue.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/GettingStartedMember.java[tag=startmember]
----
+
* Run this `GettingStarted` class a second time to get the second member
started. The members form a cluster and the output is similar to the following.
+
```
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 - e40081de-056a-4ae5-8ffe-632caf8a6cf1 this
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 - 93e82109-16bf-4b16-9c87-f4a6d0873080
]
```
+
Here, you can see the size of your cluster (`size`) and member list
version (`ver`). The member list version is incremented when changes
happen to the cluster, e.g., a member leaving from or joining to the cluster.
+
* Now, add the `hazelcast-client-`*`{page-component-version}`*`.jar` library to your classpath.
This is required to use a Hazelcast client.
* The following code starts a Hazelcast Client, connects to our cluster,
and prints the size of the `customers` map.
+
[source,java]
----
public class GettingStartedClient {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
        HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient( clientConfig );
        IMap map = client.getMap( "customers" );
        System.out.println( "Map Size:" + map.size() );
    }
}
----
+
* When you run it, you see the client properly connecting to the cluster
and printing the map size as **3**.
